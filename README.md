## ELM-FBPINN - Efficient Finite-basis Physics-informed Neural Networks.

This repository allows the user to implement ELM-FBPINN for a simple 1D Harmonic Oscillator problem. While it can be adapted to different problems, the user has to update the specific functions.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/strathanderson/ELM-FBPINN.git
```
2. To install the relevant dependencies use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Navigate to the relevant directory:
```bash
cd ELM-FBPINN
```

3. Open "Example.ipynb".
